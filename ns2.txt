1. Ping
 Purpose: Tests the reachability of a host on a network and measures the round-trip time.
 Usage: Ping a remote host (e.g., google.com).
 Command: ping google.com
 Explanation: Sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the host, and the host responds with Echo
Reply packets. This helps determine whether the host is reachable and measures the time taken
for the packets to travel.
2. Ipconfig
 Purpose: Displays network configuration information such as IP address, subnet mask, and
default gateway for all network interfaces.
 Usage: Display IP configuration.
 Command: ipconfig
 Explanation: Shows the IP addresses of all active network interfaces. Useful for troubleshooting
network connectivity issues.
3. NetStat
 Purpose: Displays network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics.
 Usage: Show current active connections and ports in use.
 Command: netstat
 Explanation: Lists active connections, listening ports, routing tables, and other network-related
statistics, which is useful for diagnosing network issues.
4. NbtStat
 Purpose: Displays protocol statistics and the current NetBIOS over TCP/IP connections.
 Usage: Show local NetBIOS names.
 Command: nbtstat -n
 Explanation: Displays the local NetBIOS names registered on the computer. Can help in
troubleshooting NetBIOS issues in a local network.
5. Hostname
 Purpose: Displays or sets the system's hostname.
 Usage: Show the hostname of the system.
 Command: hostname
 Explanation: Displays the name of the computer on the network, which is useful for identifying
systems in a network environment.
6. Systeminfo
 Purpose: Displays detailed configuration information about the computer, such as OS version,
memory, uptime, etc.
 Usage: Show system information.
 Command: systeminfo
 Explanation: Provides detailed information about the operating system, hardware resources, and
system uptime, useful for diagnostics.
7. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
 Purpose: Displays and modifies the IP-to-Physical address mapping.
 Usage: Show the ARP table.
 Command: arp -a
 Explanation: Shows the mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses on the local
network, useful for troubleshooting network-related issues.
8. Nslookup
 Purpose: Queries the DNS to obtain the domain name or IP address mappings.
 Usage: Lookup the IP address of a domain.
 Command: nslookup google.com
 Explanation: Queries the DNS server for the IP address associated with the domain google.com.
This is useful for DNS troubleshooting and verification.
9. Tracert
 Purpose: Traces the route packets take to a destination host.
 Usage: Trace the route to a remote host.
 Command: tracert google.com
 Explanation: Displays each hop a packet takes from the source to the destination. Useful for
diagnosing routing issues or network congestion.
10. PingPath
 Purpose: Similar to tracert, but provides packet loss information at each hop.
 Usage: Trace the route with packet loss information.
 Command: pingpath google.com
 Explanation: Note: pingpath might not be available on all systems. It provides similar
functionality to tracert but with additional details on packet loss along the path. On Windows,
tracert is more commonly used.
11. GetMac
 Purpose: Displays the MAC addresses of network interfaces.
 Usage: Show the MAC addresses of all network interfaces.
 Command: getmac
 Explanation: Displays the physical MAC addresses for each active network interface. Useful for
identifying devices on the local network.
12. Route
 Purpose: Displays or modifies the routing table of the computer.
 Usage: Show the routing table.
 Command: route print
 Explanation: Shows the routing table, which lists the paths that packets take to different
destinations on the network. It helps in troubleshooting routing issues.
13. NetDiag
 Purpose: Diagnoses network-related problems (this command is more commonly available on
Windows systems).
 Usage: Run a network diagnostic.
 Command: netdiag
 Explanation: Note: netdiag is primarily available in Windows Server environments and performs
diagnostics on the network configuration and connectivity.
